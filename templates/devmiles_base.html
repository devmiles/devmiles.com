				<p>It's a common belief in the software world that some technologies or platforms are better than the other. We are sure you've heard statements that Java is better than .NET or Ruby is better than Python. Misled by those convictions people choose technologies before they even entirely understand the problems they need to solve. At devmiles we put business requirements first and select technologies that fit best. We make sure that software produced at devmiles is on par with the highest industry standards. Our approach resulted in a number of successful products we are proud of!</p>
